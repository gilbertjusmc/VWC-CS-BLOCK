# Assignment
1. Implement a Class for each of Set, Stack, Queue, Map
2. Each one should cover all of its capabilities
3. Each one can be initalized either empty (no parameters), OR with initial values
4. Implement obj.isEmpty()
5. Implement a “Type” Parameter (optional)
- This parameter enforces types in your data structure, ie, all strings, all integers, etc.
- Will throw error (or output a message) if you add a value that is not of the correct type
- For Map, you will need two of these, one for Key, one for Value

## Notes:
For Map, you can ONLY USE arrays. NO OBJECT-LITERALS. - That’s cheating!
Avoid built-in functions, if it feels like a shortcut, then it is a shortcut

## Extras:
Implement obj_1.equals(obj_2), where both objs are of the same Class
This checks if all values (and in some cases, the order) are equal

Congrats, you’ve built four of your own data structures!

You are free to add and manipulate them how you like!
For example, look up Priority Queue (little advanced)
